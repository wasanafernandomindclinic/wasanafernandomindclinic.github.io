***Hello, Welcome to my corner of the Web!***

I'm **Wasana Fernando**, a **Trainee Clinical Psychologist** currently pursuing my **M.Phil. in Clinical Psychology** at the **University of Colombo**. With a background in psychology that spans multiple disciplines, I'm passionate about integrating clinical work, research, education, and community outreach to improve mental health and wellbeing.

My educational journey began with a **B.A. (Hons.) in Psychology** from the **University of Kelaniya**, followed by an **MBC** from the **University of Hong Kong**. I also hold a **Diploma in Counselling** and an **Advanced Diploma in Psychotherapy** from the **Sri Lanka Mental Health Foundation (SLMHF)**, equipping me with both academic and practical knowledge in mental health care.

Since **November 2022**, I've been involved in **mental health research** as a **Research Interviewer** for the "**Let's Work Heart**" project, a collaboration between the **NTEC CREC** and the **Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**. This project focuses on collecting psychiatric epidemiological data from ethnic minority children, youth, and parents, an experience that has enriched my understanding of mental health across diverse communities. In addition, I serve as a **Mental Health Ambassador** for the "**Mind to Heart**" project, co-founded by **Okay Mind** and **CEDARS - The University of Hong Kong**, promoting mental health awareness and wellness in the community.

Clinically, I've had the privilege of working at some of Sri Lanka's leading medical institutions, including the **National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL)**, **Colombo North Teaching Hospital (CNTH)**, and **Teaching Hospital Peradeniya(THP)**. Over the course of **18 months** in various placements, I've worked in **psychiatric clinics**, **child and adolescent services**, **adult and geriatric care**, as well as **neurocognitive and psychological assessments**. My time at the **Ayati National Centre** expanded my skills in **multidisciplinary child developmental care**, and working with the **Alzheimer's Association of Sri Lanka** allowed me to support dementia patients and caregivers with cognitive assessments and mental health resources.

Alongside my clinical work, I focus on psychotherapy and therapeutic techniques such as **group therapy for BPD**, **parent training for ADHD**, **anger management for inpatients**, and **stress management** programs for medical students. I also lead **grief and bereavement education** sessions, specifically helping medical students learn how to break bad news with **empathy and professionalism**.

I am particularly drawn to the integration of **Buddhist psychology** in psychotherapy, using techniques like **mindfulness** and **compassion** to facilitate healing and emotional balance. This unique approach has allowed me to hold public workshops and provide individual therapy grounded in the application of **Buddhist principles** in mental health.

As an educator, I've been fortunate to hold roles as a **Visiting Lecturer** and **Assistant Lecturer** at several institutions. I've lectured at **Oxford Lanka Medical Pvt. Ltd.**, the **University of Kelaniya**, **Sipway Educational Institute**, and the **Kelani Institute for External Degrees**, where I shared my knowledge with students and contributed to their academic development. My passion for research also led me to work as a **Research Assistant** at the **Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies** at the **University of Kelaniya**, analyzing data from the Pali Canon (Tripitaka) and contributing to academic publications.

Beyond academia, I've written extensively as a **freelance psychology journalist** at **Nerdynaut**, sharing psychological insights through articles that make complex concepts more accessible to the public. Earlier in my career, I also worked as an **Assistant Teacher** at the **SAVI Academy of Art**, where I supported children with diverse abilities through creative arts.

My journey has always been guided by a holistic approach to mental health---one that nurtures emotional, physical, social, and spiritual wellbeing. I'm passionate about providing spaces for people to not just recover, but truly thrive. Whether through my clinical work, teaching, writing, or community outreach, my mission is to make a meaningful impact on the mental health landscape, empowering individuals to live healthier, more fulfilling lives.
