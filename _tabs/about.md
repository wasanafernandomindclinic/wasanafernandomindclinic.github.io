Hello, and thank you for visiting my space on the web!

I’m **Wasana Fernando**, a Trainee Clinical Psychologist currently pursuing an **M.Phil. in Clinical Psychology** at the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. My work is driven by a deep commitment to enhancing mental health and well-being, with a holistic approach that integrates clinical practice, research, education, and community outreach.

## Educational Background

I hold a **Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) in Psychology** from the University of Kelaniya, where my passion for mental health began. I further pursued a **Master’s in Buddhist Ayurvedic Counselling**, which combines **Theravada Buddhism**, its teachings, and wisdom with modern therapeutic practices. I then earned a **Master of Buddhist Counselling (MBC)** from the University of Hong Kong, specializing in **Buddhist teachings** and **mindfulness-based awareness training techniques**, including **Dhamma Therapy**.

## Clinical Experience

Over the past **18+ months**, I have trained at several leading Sri Lankan healthcare institutions, including:

- **National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL)**
- **Colombo North Teaching Hospital (CNTH)**
- **Teaching Hospital Peradeniya (THP)**
- **Ayati National Centre for Children with Disabilities**
- **Lanka Alzheimer's Association**

My experience spans a wide range of services, such as **adult psychiatric care**, **child and adolescent psychiatry**, **geriatric psychiatry**, **pain management**, and the **administration of various neurocognitive assessments**.

## Psychotherapeutic Approach

My psychotherapeutic work includes:

- Individual and group therapy for *"Resilient Hearts"* – clients with **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)**
- **Anger management** programs for psychiatric inpatients
- **Parent training** for children with **ADHD** and **Down syndrome**
- **Stress reduction programs** for mental healthcare professionals
- **Grief and bereavement discussions** for healthcare providers

## Integrating Psychology with Buddhist Practices

A core aspect of my practice is integrating **Theravada Buddhist teachings** into psychotherapy. Through **mindfulness**, related **awareness training**, and **Dhamma Therapy**, I offer individual therapy and group workshops that blend psychological insight with spiritual wisdom—helping clients build **resilience** and **emotional balance**.

## Research & Advocacy

As a **Research Assistant** at the **Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies**, I explored the intersection of Buddhist teachings based on the **Pali Canon (Tripitaka)**.

Since 2022, I’ve worked as a **Research Interviewer** for the *Let’s Work Heart* project, focusing on **psychiatric epidemiology** among **ethnic minority children, youth, and parents**.

As a **Mental Health Ambassador** for the *Mind to Heart* campaign, I actively **promote mental wellness** and work to **reduce stigma** surrounding mental illness.

## Teaching & Writing

I have served as a **lecturer in psychology** at:

- University of Kelaniya
- Institute of External Degrees
- Oxford Lanka Medical Pvt. Ltd.

Additionally, I have written extensively for **Nerdynaut**, simplifying complex psychological topics for general audiences. I also have experience supporting **children with diverse abilities** through **creative arts interventions** at the **SAVI Academy of Art**.

## Vision

My work is guided by a commitment to delivering **compassionate**, **inclusive**, **integrated**, and **evidence-based** mental health services. I aim to create therapeutic spaces that address **holistic well-being**, empowering individuals and communities to not just recover, but truly **thrive**.

Through **psychotherapy**, **teaching**, **research**, and **advocacy**, my goal is to help people lead **healthier, more fulfilling lives**.
