How a Simple Sensory Tool Kit Can Help You Feel Calmer.


March 29, 2025

Life can be stressful. Sometimes, emotions feel overwhelming, and it's hard to calm down. This is especially true for people with  borderline personality disorder (BPD), anxiety, PTSD, or sensory challenges. A simple but effective way to manage emotions is by using a  sensory soothing kit, a small collection of comforting items that help you feel calm and grounded.

What is a Sensory Soothing Kit?
-------------------------------

A sensory soothing kit is a  box or bag filled with things that help you relax  by using your senses. Such as touch, sight, sound, smell, and taste. These kits are often used in therapy to help with emotional regulation, but anyone can benefit from them.

Why Does It Work?
-----------------

Our senses affect how we feel. When we focus on  pleasant  sensations, we can feel calmer and more in control.

For example:

-   Holding a  soft object  can bring comfort.
-   Watching a  glitter jar  can be soothing.
-   Smelling  lavender  can ease stress.
-   Sipping  warm tea  can provide relaxation.

What to Put in a Sensory Kit?
-----------------------------

You can customize your kit with items that work best for you. Here are some ideas:

### 1\. Touch -- Things That Feel Comforting

✔️ Soft fabrics (like a small blanket or stuffed toy)

✔️ Stress balls or fidget toys

✔️ Hot/cold packs for a soothing sensation

### 2\. Sight -- Things That Are Calming to Look At

✔️ A small lava lamp or glitter jar

✔️ Pictures of nature or loved ones

✔️ Soft fairy lights for a gentle glow

### 3\. Sound -- Things That Are Soothing to Hear

✔️ Relaxing music or nature sounds

✔️ Noise-canceling headphones

✔️ A small chime or rain sounds app

### 4\. Smell -- Things That Bring a Sense of Comfort

✔️ Essential oils (lavender for calm, peppermint for focus)

✔️ Scented candles or lotion

✔️ Herbal tea bags (which smell nice and can be enjoyed as a drink)

### 5\. Taste -- Things That Are Grounding

✔️ Mints or gum

✔️ Dark chocolate or crunchy snacks

✔️ Warm tea for comfort

How to Use Your Kit

Sensory kits are great for people with  BPD, anxiety, PTSD, or sensory processing issues. But they can help anyone feel calmer in stressful times.

Takeaway
--------

A sensory soothing kit is  a simple, affordable, and effective way to manage emotions. Whether for yourself or someone you care about, having comforting items on hand can make a big difference
