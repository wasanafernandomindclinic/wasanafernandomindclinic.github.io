Rethinking Maslow, Adapting the Hierarchy of Needs for Sri Lankan Culture in Mental Health Practice

December 14, 2024

> This article is written based on the visionary insights of one of my professors, who encouraged me to consider the Sri Lankan cultural context, the power of diversity, and its implications for mental health services as a mental healthcare professional.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a widely acknowledged theory of human motivation. However, its relevance in diverse cultural settings, especially in Sri Lanka, is notably limited. Originally crafted within a Western, individualistic paradigm, the model highlights a sequential advancement of needs, from basic survival to self-actualization.

Sri Lankan culture's strong emphasis on collectivism, spirituality, and community values can indeed challenge the applicability of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. For mental health professionals, appreciating these cultural nuances is crucial for providing effective and culturally sensitive care. Recognizing the importance of family, community, and spiritual practices can make a significant difference in therapy and support efforts.

### Understanding the Cultural Misalignment

In Sri Lanka, family, community, and spirituality play a central role in people's lives. These cultural values often conflict with the individualistic goals proposed by Maslow. For instance:

-   Collectivistic Values:

In Sri Lankan culture, individuals prioritize family and community well-being over personal needs. Even when basic physiological or safety needs are unmet, people may focus on social belonging or fulfilling familial obligations.

-   Spirituality as a Priority:

Many Sri Lankans prioritize spiritual growth and religious commitments over material or safety needs, which goes beyond Maslow's framework. Spiritual fulfillment often takes precedence over self-actualization.

-   Social Recognition Over Basic Needs:

Economic disparities mean that while some struggle to meet basic needs, they still actively seek social belonging or esteem within their communities, reflecting the interdependence of needs rather than a strict hierarchy.

-   Barriers to Discussing Sexuality

In Sri Lanka, openly discussing sexuality is often taboo due to limited sexual literacy and the lack of representation of sexuality as an art form or a subject within popular culture. These barriers not only impact personal relationships but also hinder individuals' ability to access mental health care related to sexual well-being. As a result, professionals must approach these topics with sensitivity, awareness, and an understanding of cultural restrictions.

### Why Mental Health Professionals Should Be Aware

For mental health professionals, these cultural differences offer critical insights into tailoring effective interventions. Here's why this awareness matters:

-   Culturally Relevant Treatment

Clients' motivations and coping mechanisms are shaped by their cultural values. For example, instead of focusing solely on personal growth, professionals should address the importance of family dynamics, community connections, and spiritual practices in the client's mental health.

-   Avoiding Misdiagnosis

Misinterpreting behaviors driven by cultural priorities can lead to incorrect diagnoses. A client prioritizing spiritual goals over material needs is not neglecting themselves but aligning with cultural norms. Recognizing this prevents pathologizing culturally appropriate behaviors.

-   Building Therapeutic Rapport

Acknowledging and respecting cultural values fosters trust and encourages clients to engage more openly in therapy. Recognizing the importance of family obligations or spiritual practices can make clients feel understood and valued.

-   Adapting Interventions

Mental health interventions must align with cultural realities. For instance, integrating community support or spiritual practices into therapy may be more effective than focusing solely on individualistic goals like self-actualization.

-   Understanding Collective Resilience

Sri Lanka's history of socio-political challenges has cultivated strong community-based coping mechanisms. Mental health professionals can harness these collective strengths to enhance therapeutic outcomes.

### Practical Implications

Maslow's theory can still provide a foundation for understanding motivation, but it needs to be adapted for the Sri Lankan context. For instance:

1.  Emphasize interdependence over independence in therapy goals.
2.  Incorporate spiritual and religious values into mental health practices.
3.  Recognize the role of family and community in shaping a client's sense of belonging and self-worth.
4.  Address social and economic factors that influence unmet basic needs while respecting the client's pursuit of higher-order goals.
5.  Develop culturally appropriate strategies to gently explore topics like sexuality while respecting the client's boundaries.

### Conclusion

Mental health is deeply influenced by culture, and understanding these cultural nuances is crucial for professionals. In Sri Lanka, where collectivism, spirituality, and community well-being dominate, Maslow's linear hierarchy may not fully align with clients' lived experiences. Furthermore, the cultural barriers surrounding sexuality highlight the importance of adopting a sensitive, informed approach. By integrating cultural awareness into practice, mental health professionals can provide more empathetic, relevant, and effective care, fostering deeper connections and better outcomes.
