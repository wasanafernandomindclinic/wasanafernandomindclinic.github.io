Mindful Circle Breathing, Symbolic Drawing, and Affirmations, A Therapeutic Approach for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

March 29, 2025

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is often associated with emotional dysregulation, identity disturbances, and intense interpersonal relationships. While evidence-based treatments like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) remain essential, mindfulness-based creative techniques can offer additional benefits for emotional regulation and self-awareness.

In this article, we explore how mindful circle breathing, mindful drawing with symbols, mandala coloring, and affirmations can be powerful tools in therapy for individuals with BPD

1\. Mindful Circle Breathing: Grounding the Emotions
----------------------------------------------------

Mindful breathing is a fundamental technique in mindfulness-based therapy, but combining it with drawing a circle enhances its effectiveness in emotional grounding.

### How It Works:

-   Draw a  large circle  on paper or visualize one in your mind.
-   Inhale  slowly while tracing the first half of the circle.
-   Exhale  while completing the second half.
-   Maintain a  rhythmic, slow breath  while focusing on the movement and sensation of drawing.

### Benefits for BPD:

-   Helps regulate intense emotions, reducing impulsivity.
-   Creates a  visual and sensory focus, preventing dissociation.
-   Encourages mindfulness, bringing attention to the present moment.

This practice can be particularly helpful during emotional distress, as it provides a  structured and soothing  activity that fosters self-regulation.

2\. Mindful Drawing with Symbols: Expressing Inner Emotions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Symbolic drawing is a creative way to  externalize emotions that may be difficult to verbalize.

### How It Works:

-   Select a  symbol  that resonates with your current emotion (a wave for emotional turbulence, a tree for stability).
-   Use  colors, shapes, and patterns  to visually represent your emotions.
-   Engage in  repetitive, calming strokes, such as spirals or mandalas, to promote relaxation.

### Benefits for BPD:

-   Provides a  non-verbal outlet  for overwhelming emotions.
-   Helps process past traumas in a  safe and controlled  way.
-   Strengthens  self-identity  by externalizing internal experiences.

This technique fosters emotional release while reducing the urge for maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as self-harm or emotional outbursts.

3\. Mindful Coloring Mandala: Finding Balance and Focus
-------------------------------------------------------

Mandala coloring is a well-researched mindfulness practice that promotes  calmness, emotional balance, and structured thinking.

### How It Works:

-   Select a  mandala pattern  (geometric or nature-inspired).
-   Use colors  intuitively  to reflect your emotions.
-   Focus on  each stroke and color choice, staying present in the moment.

### Benefits for BPD:

-   Engages both hemispheres of the brain, fostering  emotional regulation and concentration.
-   Reduces stress by  creating order and predictability  in patterns.
-   Promotes  self-expression and relaxation  through creativity.

Studies have shown that mandala coloring  lowers anxiety and increases mindfulness, making it an ideal practice for individuals experiencing  emotional instability.

4\. Affirmations with Drawing: Rewiring Self-Perception
-------------------------------------------------------

Negative self-talk is a common challenge for individuals with BPD.  Affirmations, when combined with visual elements, reinforce positive self-perception and challenge self-critical thoughts.

### How It Works:

-   Write a  positive affirmation  related to self-worth or emotional resilience (I am worthy of love and stability).
-   Decorate it with  symbols, colors, or patterns  that evoke safety and strength.
-   Repeat the affirmation  aloud or silently  while drawing.
-   Place the artwork somewhere visible as a daily reminder.

### Benefits for BPD:

-   Helps counteract  self-destructive thought patterns.
-   Encourages emotional resilience and self-acceptance.
-   Provides  a tangible, visual anchor  for self-empowerment.

By actively engaging in affirmations through  drawing and mindfulness, individuals can reshape their inner narrative and cultivate self-compassion.

Integrating These Techniques into Therapy
-----------------------------------------

A structured approach can enhance the effectiveness of these methods:

1.  Begin  with mindful circle breathing to center emotions.
2.  Transition  into mindful drawing with symbols to explore and express feelings.
3.  End  with affirmations to reinforce positive self-beliefs.

These techniques can be practiced independently or incorporated into  therapeutic sessions, offering a  holistic and creative pathway  to emotional healing.

Final Thoughts
--------------

For individuals with BPD, self-regulation and emotional stability can feel like a constant challenge. However, by integrating  mindfulness, creativity, and self-affirmation, they can develop healthier ways to  process emotions, enhance self-awareness, and build self-compassion.

As mental health professionals, incorporating these approaches into therapy can provide  gentle, yet transformative  tools for clients navigating emotional distress.
